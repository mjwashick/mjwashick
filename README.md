# Marshall Washick
**Continuous Quality Improvement (EMS) • Data & Analytics • Systems Thinker**  
*Sharper Systems, Smarter Results.*

Hi, I’m Marshall (Marsh). I build data‑driven systems that make prehospital care safer, faster, and smarter. My toolkit blends improvement science, EMS domain expertise, and analytics in R - shipped as usable dashboards, reproducible reports, and pragmatic playbooks teams can actually run.

---

### What I’m focused on
- **Driving the use of Improvement Science** - testing and exploring new ways of applying analytical tools in novel ways for prehospital and emergency medicine.
- **Data Strategy @ DC Fire & EMS** - DAMA‑aligned roadmap for trustworthy data, analytics, and AI readiness.
- **Using Statistical Process Control for Human Behavior** - applying the analytical rules of statistical process control in non-standard ways.
- **NEMSIS 3.4 → 3.5 Clinical Data Transition** — governance, quality rules, and analytics migration.

### Featured projects
- 🧪 **Orthogonal Array Testing (OAT) in EMS QI** — methods + case study (draft manuscript).
- 📦 **`DcStyle`** — a ggplot2 theme aligned to the DC Style Guide.
- 📚 **Intro to Prehospital Analytics** — a Quarto book in progress.

### Writing & speaking
- **EMS QI Desk** — practical notes on SPC, experimentation, and ops improvement.  
- Talks on **Shewhart charts**, **run rules vs detection power**, and **data strategy for public safety**.
