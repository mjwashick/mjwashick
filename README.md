# Marshall Washick
**Continuous Quality Improvement (EMS) • Data & Analytics • Systems Thinker**  
*Sharper Systems, Smarter Results.*

Hi, I’m Marshall (Marsh). I build data‑driven systems that make prehospital care safer, faster, and smarter. My toolkit blends improvement science, EMS domain expertise, and analytics in R - shipped as usable dashboards, reproducible reports, and pragmatic playbooks teams can actually run.

---

### What I’m focused on
- **Driving the use of Improvement Science** - testing and exploring new ways of applying analytical tools in novel ways for prehospital and emergency medicine.
- **Data Strategy @ DC Fire & EMS** - DAMA‑aligned roadmap for trustworthy data, analytics, and AI readiness.
- **Using Statistical Process Control for Human Behavior** - applying the analytical rules of statistical process control in non-standard ways.
- **NEMSIS 3.4 → 3.5 Clinical Data Transition** — governance, quality rules, and analytics migration.


## 🚀 Featured Projects

- 🧪 **Orthogonal Array Testing (OAT) in EMS QI**  
  Demonstrates efficient experimentation for improving prehospital care—reducing trial burden while revealing key drivers of performance.  

- 🎨 **DcStyle – ggplot2 Theme**  
  A custom visualization theme aligned to the DC Style Guide for consistent, professional-grade analytics reporting.  

- 📚 **Intro to Prehospital Analytics**
  Book in progress!

- 🔗 **EMS Data Ingestion Pipeline (R + SQL)**  
  Proof-of-concept workflow for automating daily data ingestion from CSV into a structured SQL warehouse to reduce silos and enable reliable dashboards.  

- 🚑 **Advanced Airway Management QI Toolkit**  
  Practical tools and analytic templates to support a national effort to reduce intubation-related harm in prehospital care.

### Writing & speaking
- **EMS QI Desk** — practical notes on SPC, experimentation, and ops improvement.  
- Talks on **Shewhart charts**, **run rules vs detection power**, and **data strategy for public safety**.
